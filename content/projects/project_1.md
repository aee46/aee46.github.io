Part A
======

The first part of this lab focused on becoming familiar with the Arduino IDE by running example programs on the Artemis MCU.

After installing the Arduino IDE and the Artemis Board Manager, I connected the Artemis to my laptop using a USB-C cable. This allowed me to download and execute code from my laptop onto the Artemis.

Blink
======
The "Blink" program configures the onboard LED in its output state. Then, the program turns the LED on and off by writing a digital 1 and 0 respectively to the LED's pin. To make the LED blink, the code waits one second in between each logic transition. In summary, the LED turns on for one second, then turns off for one second, and then the process repeats. Here is a video of my Artemis executing the blink program:

Code Template
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
